This repository is for disassembling the built-in ROM of the Rinco Talkman, a Famiclone from 1997 capable of outputting audio samples of larger audio quality than the NES' 2A03 can handle. More information [here](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/NES_2.0_Mapper_594).

The ROM comes bundled with three games:
* *Os Cavaleiros do Zodíaco*: Never-before-seen fighting game by Hummer Team of the same year based on Saint Seiya
* *The Dragon*: Enhanced version from 1996 of a 1995 game by an Ex-Sachen developer team
* *Captain Bassam*: New translation hack to Arabic of Captain Tsubasa II<br>
All three of these were authored by Rinco and featured voice acting as the main attractive point.
